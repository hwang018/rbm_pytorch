Covering:
1. Restricted Boltzmann Machine based recommender.
2. Autoencoder based recommender.

Both models are using 1M version MovieLens dataset, containing ~6k users.

- common: includes utility functions shared by different recommender systems.
- models: includes each model's structure script.
- dataset: datasets used in this project.
