## Recommender Models based on pytorch
Covering RBM recommendation and Autoencoder recommendation models.
1. Restricted Boltzmann Machine based recommender.
2. Autoencoder based recommender.

Both models are using 1M version MovieLens dataset, containing ~6k users.

- common: includes utility functions shared by different recommender systems.
- models: includes each model's structure script.
- dataset: datasets used in this project.
